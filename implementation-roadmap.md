// Search state
const useSearchStore = create((set) => ({
  query: '',
  filters: {},
  results: [],
  setQuery: (query) => set({ query }),
  setFilters: (filters) => set({ filters }),
}))

// User state
const useAuthStore = create((set) => ({
  user: null,
  token: null,
  login: (user, token) => set({ user, token }),
  logout: () => set({ user: null, token: null }),
}))
```

**Backend State (Redis)**
```typescript
// Session management
const sessionStore = new Redis({
  host: process.env.REDIS_HOST,
  port: process.env.REDIS_PORT,
})

// Caching strategy
const cacheKey = `search:${hash(searchParams)}`
const cachedResults = await redis.get(cacheKey)
```
